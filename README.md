This project is a brandbook page with adaptive layout that automatically generates and restructures
content for both desktop and mobile devices. It leverages calculations of existing blocks to build a
dynamic grid system, resulting in a visually engaging and flexible design. The implementation
focuses on:

- Responsive structure – different layouts for PC and mobile, created automatically.
- Dynamic grid effect – based on block calculations, generating unique compositions.
- Scalable approach – easy to expand with new sections and brandbook elements.

The goal is to provide a modern and interactive brandbook presentation with smooth adaptation to
various screen sizes.
